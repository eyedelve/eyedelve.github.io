      'content': "\"What can we expect? OSCE in DNB is starting again after about 10 years as a part of final DNB examination and the mode is virtual for the first time. According to the intimation offered, we will be given 25 questions of 8 marks each i.e 200 marks overall with 5 minutes per question. Let us see the probable things which can be used as the questions.\\n For simplicity sake, 25 questions can translate into 8 sub parts having 1 mark each with 5 minutes to type in the answer. It may be less, but let\\u0026rsquo;s stick with that for the time being.\\n   Let us see the type of questions. First type: An image is provided to you and direct questions related to that image. These types of questions are easy to recall and write. Eg. A single drug photo with related questions about mode of action, mode of excretion, preservatives, contraindications, etc.\\n  The second type are the questions where the image is related to a few questions but some other aspects of a similar subject are also explored as questions. Eg. A tonometer photograph is accompanied by the principle of tonometer, question regarding its sterilisation, then grading of angle like Shaffer’s grading is asked, along with a question like where is Sampolesi’s line found, and a question about the dosage of mannitol, etc.\\n  The third type of question can be based on a printout of an instrument, like a Pentacam and questions based on certain parameters in that printout, keratoconus indices, crosslinking protocols, features of pellucid marginal generation, etc. can be asked.\\n  The fourth type of question can be based on lab investigations in ophthalmology, like ocular pathology slides identification, stain used, diagnosis of the structure and thereafter going to that disease and various features of the disease/protocols/studies may be asked.\\n  The fifth type of question can be based on community ophthalmology where the various national \\u0026amp; international programmes will be asked and various milestones can be asked about.\\n  The sixth type of question can be about miscellaneous non related subjects and it will be like a mixed bag type of a question.\\n  The seventh type of question can be based on surgical instruments and may take you towards the details of surgeries, new innovations and surgical complications/disease management.\\n  The eighth type of question may be based only on the clinical photograph and it\\u0026rsquo;s management. Here getting the diagnosis correct is the crux and it will lead you to all the answers possible. OCTs, Visual fields, HRT, AS-OCT, UBM reports, etc. will be important here.\\n  The ninth type of question can be related to a topic like optics, refraction, and orthoptics.\\n   In all these questions, single line answers will be expected. If at all, definitions can be a part of the questions.\\n It is expected that the OSCE will require cues in form of photographs for identification. If that’s the case, focus on photographs a lot. If you cannot identify the condition in one go, the rest of the answers may become difficult to answer. All sorts of drugs, instruments, disease of eye, dyes, adjuvants, instruments, IOL s, intraocular devices, machines, X-rays, CT scans and MRI scans, etc. should be seen. Google can be your friend here if you can\\u0026rsquo;t find that in your books.\\n The current OSCE series is just to prepare you with a few questions. As of now, since we know very little of what to expect, we can just try to learn based on the knowledge that we have.\\n Wish you all the very best! Let us put our best foot forward…\\n- Team EyeDelve\\n Disclaimer: All the information provided here is intended to be used for understanding of the type questions which may be expected in the forthcoming exams.
