It was once thought to be pathognomonic for FHI, was previously used as a diagnostic and confirmatory test in patients with suspected FHI   Anderson-Kestenbaum Procedure This is done for asymmetrical gaze nystagmus. In eccentric nystagmus the position of balance between the opposing muscles can be gained only by conjugate deviation. Hence, if the muscles which bring the eyes into that position of balance are weakened surgically and the counteracting muscles are strengthened, the impulse for conjugate deviation will rotate the eyes to or near the mid-position. Thus surgery has to shift the eyes into the direction opposite to the rest position, i.e. towards the side of the greater oscillation, which usually coincides with the direction of head turn and of the quick component of the nystagmus   Arden Plates The Arden grating test is a subjective clinical test of visual function introduced in a portable book form by Arden and Jacobsen in 1976. The principle of the test is the measurement of contrast sensitivity by sine-wave gratings   Arden Ratio The clinical EOG provides an indirect measure of the minimum amplitude of the standing potential in the dark (at the DT) and then again at its maximum amplitude in the light (at the LP). This is expressed as the EOG light peak-to-dark trough ratio (LP:DT ratio) or ARDEN’S RATIO   Argyll Robertson Pupil Small, irregular pupils that do not react to light but do respond to accommodation; occurs in syphilis   Argyll Robertson\\u0026rsquo;s Syndrome A frequent symptom of neurosyphilis, especially tabes dorsalis, and other diseases of the central nervous system, in which the pupil is small and responds slowly or not at all to light, but reaction to accommodation and convergence is retained   Arlt Line A thick band of scar tissue in the conjunctiva, near the lid margin,associated with eye infections like trachoma   Arlt\\u0026rsquo;s Operation Transplantation of eyelashes back from the edge of the eyelid for treatment of distichiasis   Arlt\\u0026rsquo;s Syndrome A contagious eye infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis   Arlt\\u0026rsquo;s Triangle Keratic precipitates distributed in a wedge-shaped area on the inferior corneal endothelium   Axenfeld Syndrome A syndrome characterised by posterior corneal embryotoxon, prominent Schwalbe\\u0026rsquo;s line and iris adhesion to the Schwalbe’s line   Axenfeld Loop The term is used to describe intrascleral nerve loops of the long, posterior, ciliary nerves as they pierce the sclera. The loop commonly appears as a grey, white nodule under the bulbar conjunctiva. It may be surrounded by pigment, especially in those with a darker iris. They are typically found a constant distance from the corneoscleral junction, usually within 3-4 mm of the limbus  B  Bell\\u0026rsquo;s Palsy Bell\\u0026rsquo;s palsy is a type of facial paralysis that results in a temporary inability to control the facial muscles on the affected side of the face. It is an unexplained episode of facial muscle weakness that begins suddenly and worsens over 48 hours   Bells Phenomenon It is a medical sign that allows observers to notice an upward and outward movement of the eye, when an attempt is made to close the eyes.(also called the palpebral oculogyric reflex)   Berlin’s Edema (Commotio retinae) whitening of retina in the posterior pole from disruption of photoreceptors after blunt trauma   Behr\\u0026rsquo;s Optic Atrophy A recessive form of optic atrophy which may occur in isolation or may be associated with deafness, diabetes, and neurologic complications   Behçet\\u0026rsquo;s Syndrome Recurrent systemic disease characterized by uveitis with hypopyon, recurrent ulceration of the mucous membranes of the mouth and pharynx, and ulceration of the genitalia   Bjerrum screen The Bjerrum Tangent Screen is a flat, usually black surface, used to measure the central 30 degrees of the visual field. The Bjerrum screen is made of black matte material and stitched with radial lines at 15 degree intervals and circles at 5 degree intervals   Bjerrum Scotoma A visual field defect characteristic of glaucoma. It is a nerve fiber bundle defect extending from the blind spot, sweeping around the macular region and ending in a straight line on the nasal side corresponding to the temporal raphe in the retina   Bielschowsky Phenomenon Downdrift of occluded eye as increasing neutral-density filters are placed over fixating eye in dissociated vertical deviation   Bielschowsky\\u0026rsquo;s Head Tilt Test A test for palsy of the superior oblique muscle caused by damage to the IVth cranial nerve   Bogorad Syndrome (Crocodile Tears) It is the gustolacrimal reflex results from an anomalous lacrimal gland innervation that causes profuse and inappropriate tearing in response to stimulation of the taste buds   Bowman\\u0026rsquo;s Membrane The Bowman\\u0026rsquo;s membrane (Bowman\\u0026rsquo;s layer, anterior limiting lamina, anterior elastic lamina) is a smooth, acellular, non regenerating layer, located between the superficial epithelium and the stroma in the cornea of the eye   Bowman\\u0026rsquo;s Dystrophy Typically present with normal corneas at birth but develop painful recurrent erosions, opacification, and progressive vision loss within the first decade of life . Irregular, grey-white, geographic-like opacities are located in the Bowman layer and anterior stroma. In more advanced stages of the disease, the opacities can extend to the limbus and deeper stroma. It is now known as Reis-Bücklers dystrophy, and is formerly also known as Granular corneal dystrophy type III   Bowman\\u0026rsquo;s Glands These are Olfactory glands, or branched tubulo-alveolar glands which are located in the lamina propria of the olfactory membrane. Mucus produced from these glands keeps the olfactory surface moist   Bowman Muscle It is a synonym for ciliary muscle   Brown Syndrome Brown syndrome is a vertical strabismus syndrome characterized by limited elevation of the eye in an adducted position, most often secondary to mechanical restriction of the superior oblique tendon/trochlea complex   Brown\\u0026rsquo;s Classification of Duane Syndrome Brown has classified Duane\\u0026rsquo;s syndrome according to the characteristics of the limitation of movement:  Type A: with limited abduction and less-marked limitation of adduction Type B: showing limited abduction but normal adduction Type C: the limitation of adduction exceeds the limitation of abduction. There is an exotropic deviation and a head turn to compensate the loss of adduction     Bruch\\u0026rsquo;s Membrane Bruch\\u0026rsquo;s membrane is the innermost layer of the choroid which has 5 layers. It is also called the vitreous lamina, because of its glassy microscopic appearance. It is 2-4 μm thick   Bruch\\u0026rsquo;s Glands Lymph nodes located in the palpebral conjunctiva. They are sometimes referred to as trachoma glands  C  Coat\\u0026rsquo;s White Ring It is a superficial ring of iron deposition that occurs after a metallic foreign body is removed   Coats\\u0026rsquo; Disease It is a developmental retinal vascular anomaly consisting of leaking telangiectatic and aneurysmal retinal vessels with associated lipid exudation, which frequently occurs in one eye of otherwise healthy boys in the first decade of life   Cloquet\\u0026rsquo;s Canal Also known as the hyaloid canal or Stilling\\u0026rsquo;s canal, is a transparent canal that runs from the optic nerve disc to the lens traversing the vitreous body. It serves as a perivascular sheath surrounding the hyaloid artery in the embryonic eye   Cogan\\u0026rsquo;s Sign Cogan\\u0026rsquo;s lid twitch, in patients with myasthenia. When the patient\\u0026rsquo;s eyes are directed downward for 10 to 20 seconds and the patient is then instructed to make a vertical saccade back to primary position, the upper eyelid elevates and either slowly begins to droop or else twitches several times before settling into a stable position   Cogan\\u0026rsquo;s Dystrophy Also known as the Epithelial Basement Membrane Dystrophy (also known as map-dot-fingerprint, or anterior basement membrane dystrophy). The characteristic slit lamp findings for Cogan\\u0026rsquo;s dystrophy are best described by the name \\u0026ldquo;map-dot-fingerprint.\\u0026rdquo; The \\u0026ldquo;map\\u0026rdquo; changes are the most common ones seen in many EBMD patients. They appear as amorphous or geographic, sharply demarcated clear zones within light grayish areas. The \\u0026ldquo;dots\\u0026rdquo; appear as small, irregular putty-like grayish white opacities, and the \\u0026ldquo;fingerprints\\u0026rdquo; consist of small clusters of curved, parallel lines.   Cogan Reese Disease A syndrome characterized by a matted or smudged appearance to the surface of the iris, unilateral glaucoma in the eyes with multiple peripheral anterior synechiae, multiple nodules of the iris, and ectopic Descemet\\u0026rsquo;s membrane   Cogan\\u0026rsquo;s Syndrome Syndrome of interstitial keratitis characterized by abrupt onset of vertigo, tinnitus, and usually rapid development of bilateral deafness   Cogan\\u0026rsquo;s Rule This rule states that, in a patient complaining of homonymous hemianopia, if there is an asymmetric optokinetic response (lack or diminished response in the direction of the corrective saccade when the optokinetic nystagmus (OKN) stimulus moves towards the affected lobe), the lesion is more likely to involve the deep portions of the parietal lobe that are outside the territory of the posterior cerebral artery and therefore the lesion is unlikely of vascular origin. In contrast, the asymmetric optokinetic response is usually associated with tumors, as tumors are more common in the parietal than the occipital lobe   Collier’s Sign Bilateral eyelid retraction associated with midbrain lesions  D  Dalrymple’s Sign Widened palpebral fissure secondary to upper eyelid retraction in thyroid disease   Dalen Fuch\\u0026rsquo;s Nodules Small, deep, yellow retinal lesions composed of inflammatory cells seen histologically between retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch’s membrane in sympathetic ophthalmia (also in sarcoidosis, Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome)   Drance Hemorrhage Nerve fiber layer (“splinter”) hemorrhage at disc margin in glaucoma   Doyne Honeycomb Choroiditis The occurrence of colloid bodies (drusen) observed to lie on Bruch\\u0026rsquo;s membrane in certain families who lived in Oxford, England. These drusen tended to merge together and eventually become confluent, resembling a honeycomb; hence, the name Doyne\\u0026rsquo;s honeycomb choroiditis   Dua\\u0026rsquo;s Layer It is a layer found between the corneal stroma and the descemet\\u0026rsquo;s membrane. It is about 15 micrometres thick, the fourth caudal layer, and located between the corneal stroma and Descemet\\u0026rsquo;s membrane. Despite its thinness, the layer is very strong and impervious to air.It is strong enough to withstand up to 2 bars (200 kPa) of pressure   Dua\\u0026rsquo;s Classification of Ocular Burns The Dua\\u0026rsquo;s classification is based on an estimate of limbal involvement (in clock hours) and the percentage of conjunctival involvement   Duane\\u0026rsquo;s Syndrome The characteristic lid narrowing and retraction of the globe on adduction, caused by simultaneous contraction of the medial and lateral rectus muscles, help identify the condition. Duane\\u0026rsquo;s retraction syndrome is frequently mistaken for a sixth-nerve palsy in infancy because of deficient abduction of the involved eye. In fact, as a cause of limited abduction Duane\\u0026rsquo;s syndrome is quite common in children, so it must be kept in mind  E  Eales\\u0026rsquo; Disease Idiopathic inflammatory disorder of the retinal vessels (mainly veins) with recurrent vitreous and retinal haemorrhages giving sudden visual impairment. It is thought to be related to tuberculosis   Edinger-Westphal\\u0026rsquo;s Nucleus The parasympathetic nucleus of the oculomotor nerve involves in light reflex. It is the site of damage in Argyll-Robertson\\u0026rsquo;s pupils   Elschnig\\u0026rsquo;s Pearl Translucent mass following cataract surgery caused by aberrant attempt of lens epithelium to form lens fibres   Elschnig Spots (acute) Localized yellow areas visible in retinal pigment epithelium on ophthalmoscopic exam, which represent hypertensive choroidopathy; caused by fibrinoid necrosis within choriocapillaris   Elschnig Spots (chronic) Darkened pigment areas developing over several weeks in areas of acute yellow Elschnig spots   Enroth’s Sign Eyelid edema in thyroid disease   Ellingson Syndrome (or UGH Syndrome) It is a triad of uveitis, glaucoma, and hyphema  F  Fischer Kuhnt Spots These are senile scleral plaques, with area of hyalinised sclera, anterior to horizontal rectus muscle insertion   Fuchs\\u0026rsquo; Corneal Dystrophy Familial degenerative condition of the eye seen more commonly in women, with clouding of the cornea and often complicated by glaucoma   Fuchs\\u0026rsquo; Heterochromic Cyclitis An idiopathic disorder of the eye, with heterochromia, uveitis of the lighter coloured eye, iridocyclitis, keratitic precipitates and often catarct   Fuchs\\u0026rsquo; Spot A small black spot on the fundus in high myopia, occurring after macular haemorrhage   Fuch\\u0026rsquo;s Dimples Shallow, saucerlike depression on the surface of the cornea   Fuchs Phenomenon Paradoxical lid retraction associated with eye movements during 3rd nerve regeneration. While the eye may be adducted and lid elevated, no movement up or down occurs when the vertical recti contract together. It occurs classically in exophthalmic goiter, but also due to trauma or tumor at the base of the skull, anterior poliomyelitis or vascular lesions of the brain stem, with regenerating fibres growing to wrong muscles   Fuch\\u0026rsquo;s Coloboma In this condition, the superior pole of the optic disc may appear elevated with posterior displacement of the inferior nasal disc, or the disc can be horizontally tilted, resulting in an oval-appearing optic disc with an obliquely oriented long axis. It is also known as the tilted disc syndrome   Fuch\\u0026rsquo;s Keratitis A rare form of keratitis seen in the middle-aged and elderly, characterized by bilateral bands of superficial infiltrates around the corneal margins, while the central portions remain clear   Fuch\\u0026rsquo;s Atrophy Peripheral atrophy of the optic nerve. Consists of headache, fever, cyanosis, swelling of the face, ulceration of mucocutaneous membranes, and severe conjunctivitis. Eponym indicates a nonfebrile Stevens-Johnson variant   Fleischer Ring Fleischer rings are yellowish to dark-brown pigmented rings in the peripheral cornea, resulting from iron deposition in basal epithelial cells, in the form of hemosiderin. They may be complete or broken and are indicative of keratoconus   Kayser-Fleischer Ring They are dark rings that appear to encircle the iris of the eye and are due to copper deposition in the Descemet\\u0026rsquo;s membrane. These rings first appear as a crescent at the top of the cornea. Eventually, a second crescent forms below, at 6 o\\u0026rsquo;clock, and ultimately completely encircles the cornea. It is found in Wilson\\u0026rsquo;s disease  G  Gass Classifcation of Macular Holes Gass first described his clinical observations on the evolution of a macular hole:  Stage 1 MH, or Impending MH, demonstrates a loss of the foveal depression. A stage 1A is a foveolar detachment characterized a loss of the foveal contour and a lipofuscin-colored spot. A stage 1B is a foveal detachment characterized by a lipofuscin-colored ring Stage 2 MH is defined by a full thickness break \\u0026lt; 400µm in size. It might be eccentric with an inner layer “roof.” This can occur weeks to months following Stage 1 MHs. A further decline in visual acuity is also noted. In most cases, the posterior hyaloid has been confirmed to be still attached to the fovea on OCT analysis Stage 3 MH is further progression to a hole ≥400 µm in size. Nearly 100% of stage 2 MHs progress to Stage 3 and the vision further declines. A grayish macular rim often denotes a cuff of subretinal fluid. The posterior hyaloid is noted to be detached over the macula with or without an overlying operculum Stage 4 MH is characterized by a stage 3 MH with a complete posterior vitreous detachment and Weiss ring     Gass Classification of Parafoveal Telangiectasia Macular telengiectasia is usually divided into 3 main groups:  Type 1: congenital and unilateral. Thought to be similar to and/or possibly a variant of Coats disease. Uncommon Type 2: acquired and bilateral. The most common form of the three types. Usually found in middle-aged or older patients. According to the Beaver Dam Eye Study which graded only color fundus images, Mac Tel has a prevalence of 0.1% with an average age of 63 years. Although not initially described by Gass, Yannuzzi found a slight female preponderance of 58%. Of note, on common usage, the term \\u0026lsquo;Mac Tel\\u0026rsquo; is often used to refer to Mac Tel type 2. This entry will largely focus on type 2 as it has the most clinical relevance Type 3: an poorly understood primarily occlusive phenomena which is quite rare     Goldmann Perimeter The Goldmann perimeter is a hollow white spherical bowl positioned a set distance in front of the patient. An examiner presents a test light of variable size and intensity. The light may move towards the center from the perimeter (kinetic perimetry), or it may remain in one location (static perimetry)   Goldmann Applanation Tonometer This test measures fluid pressure in your eye. The test involves using a slit lamp equipped with forehead and chin supports and a tiny, flat-tipped cone that gently comes into contact with your cornea. The test measures the amount of force needed to temporarily flatten a part of your cornea   Goldmann Goniolens This truncated-cone like device utilises mirrors to reflect the light from the iridocorneal angle into the direction of the observer (as shown by the schematic diagram). In practice the image comes out roughly orthogonal to the back surface (nearer the practitioner), making observation and magnification with a slit lamp easy and reliable. The small, curved front surface does not rest on the cornea, but instead vaults over it, with lubricating fluid filling the gap. The border of the front surface rests on the sclera   Goldman Weekers Dark Adaptometer Dark adaptation is most often tested on an instrument such as the Goldmann-Weekers adaptometer. The patient is first light-adapted to a bright background light. This light is then extinguished, and the patient, now in the dark, is presented with a series of dim light targets approximately 11° below fixation. The intensity of the test lights is controlled by neutral-density filters, and the threshold at which the test light is perceived is plotted against time. Under these conditions, the dark adaptation curve shows 2 plateaus: the first represents the cone threshold, which is usually reached in 5–10 minutes, and the second represents the rod threshold, which is reached after about 30 minutes. If the clinical interest is limited to rod sensitivity in the dark, the test can be shortened by eliminating the first step of adaptation to bright light and recording only an endpoint rod threshold, which is normally reached within about 10 minutes of dark adaptation   Goldmann Favre Disease A syndrome that consists of congenital retinoschisis indistinguishable ophthalmoscopically from the X-linked recessive type with pigmentation in the fundus, complete night blindness, or loss of the scotopic b-wave of the ERG.The disease is transmitted by autosomal recessive inheritance   Globe’s Sign Lid lag on upgaze in thyroid disease   Graefe\\u0026rsquo;s Sign Von Graefe\\u0026rsquo;s sign is the lagging of the upper eyelid on downward rotation of the eye, indicating exophthalmic goiter (Graves\\u0026rsquo; Disease).It is a dynamic sign, whereas lid lag is a static sign which may also be present in cicatricial eyelid retraction or congenital ptosis   Graefe\\u0026rsquo;s Knife The von Graefe knife was a tool used to make corneal incisions in cataract surgery   Gunn’s Sign Arteriovenous nicking in hypertensive retinopathy  H  Haab\\u0026rsquo;s Striae Breaks in Descemet’s membrane (horizontal or concentric with limbus) in congenital glaucoma (versus vertical tears associated with birth trauma)   Haab\\u0026rsquo;s Reflex Attention reflex with contraction of pupils without alteration of the eye’s position (accommodation or convergence) when attention is on a bright object in the periphery of vision. May indicate a cortical lesion   Haab\\u0026rsquo;s Magnet A powerful magnet used for removing metallic particles from the eye.

They create a bypass route of tear drainage when the normal tear ducts fail and alternative techniques to provide drainage are not possible   Jones Test I \\u0026amp; II   The Jones I Test or Primary Dye Test investigates lacrimal outflow under normal physiologic conditions. The examiner instills fluorescein into the conjunctival fornices and recovers it in the inferior nasal meatus by passing a cotton-tipped wire applicator into the region of the ostium of the NLD at 2 and 5 minutes. As this test occasionally yields abnormal results in normal patients, it is not uniformly performed The nonphysiologic Jones II Test determines the presence or absence of fluorescein in the irrigating saline fluid retrieved from the nose. This test is performed as follows. The residual fluorescein is flushed from the conjunctival sac following an unsuccessful Jones I test. This is done so that the examiner can determine whether any reflux upon irrigation contains fluorescein. Irrigation of the lacrimal drainage system is performed with clear saline, which is retrieved from the inner aspect of the nose     Jones Procedure The direct plication of lower lid retractors from the skin side to correct entropion  K  Kestenbaum Pupil Number Kestenbaum\\u0026rsquo;s Number (K) is the difference in the pupil size attained in each eye under direct illumination while the other eye is occluded   Kestenbaum Test The above test of noting the size of the pupil of the unoccluded eye under direct illumination while the other eye is occluded is known as the Kestenbaum test   Kestenbaum Sign A decrease in the number of arterioles crossing optic disk margins as a sign of optic neurtis   Krachmer Spots These are in stromal graft rejection and sub eoithelial infiltrates   Krause\\u0026rsquo;s Glands Accessory lacrimal glands   Khodadoust Line A Khodadoust line separates immunologically damaged endothelium from unaffected endothelium.

      'content': "\"What can we expect? OSCE in DNB is starting again after about 10 years as a part of final DNB examination and the mode is virtual for the first time. According to the intimation offered, we will be given 25 questions of 8 marks each i.e 200 marks overall with 5 minutes per question. Let us see the probable things which can be used as the questions.\\n For simplicity sake, 25 questions can translate into 8 sub parts having 1 mark each with 5 minutes to type in the answer. It may be less, but let\\u0026rsquo;s stick with that for the time being.\\n   Let us see the type of questions. First type: An image is provided to you and direct questions related to that image. These types of questions are easy to recall and write. Eg. A single drug photo with related questions about mode of action, mode of excretion, preservatives, contraindications, etc.\\n  The second type are the questions where the image is related to a few questions but some other aspects of a similar subject are also explored as questions. Eg. A tonometer photograph is accompanied by the principle of tonometer, question regarding its sterilisation, then grading of angle like Shaffer’s grading is asked, along with a question like where is Sampolesi’s line found, and a question about the dosage of mannitol, etc.\\n  The third type of question can be based on a printout of an instrument, like a Pentacam and questions based on certain parameters in that printout, keratoconus indices, crosslinking protocols, features of pellucid marginal generation, etc. can be asked.\\n  The fourth type of question can be based on lab investigations in ophthalmology, like ocular pathology slides identification, stain used, diagnosis of the structure and thereafter going to that disease and various features of the disease/protocols/studies may be asked.\\n  The fifth type of question can be based on community ophthalmology where the various national \\u0026amp; international programmes will be asked and various milestones can be asked about.\\n  The sixth type of question can be about miscellaneous non related subjects and it will be like a mixed bag type of a question.\\n  The seventh type of question can be based on surgical instruments and may take you towards the details of surgeries, new innovations and surgical complications/disease management.\\n  The eighth type of question may be based only on the clinical photograph and it\\u0026rsquo;s management. Here getting the diagnosis correct is the crux and it will lead you to all the answers possible. OCTs, Visual fields, HRT, AS-OCT, UBM reports, etc. will be important here.\\n  The ninth type of question can be related to a topic like optics, refraction, and orthoptics.\\n   In all these questions, single line answers will be expected. If at all, definitions can be a part of the questions.\\n It is expected that the OSCE will require cues in form of photographs for identification. If that’s the case, focus on photographs a lot. If you cannot identify the condition in one go, the rest of the answers may become difficult to answer. All sorts of drugs, instruments, disease of eye, dyes, adjuvants, instruments, IOL s, intraocular devices, machines, X-rays, CT scans and MRI scans, etc. should be seen. Google can be your friend here if you can\\u0026rsquo;t find that in your books.\\n The current OSCE series is just to prepare you with a few questions. As of now, since we know very little of what to expect, we can just try to learn based on the knowledge that we have.\\n Wish you all the very best! Let us put our best foot forward…\\n- Team EyeDelve\\n Disclaimer: All the information provided here is intended to be used for understanding of the type questions which may be expected in the forthcoming exams.
